* 4HP
* Maximum output voltage ~0-10V (with a bit attack it's around 0-8V)
* Based on the ADSR from YUSYNTH/Jonathan Jacky
* A similar envelope generator can also be found in Arturia's Microbrute and Minibrute
* Transistor based gate/trigger conditioning circuit in those designs were replaced with an opamp based one
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: ~40mm
