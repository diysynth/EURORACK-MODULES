# OFFSET/GAIN UTILITY (4HP)

* Multifunctional module for CV and audio signals
* Can be used to amplify, attenuate, invert or offset signals and voltages
* With nothing connected to the input it outputs a fixed voltage that can be adjusted with the potentiometers 
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: â‰ˆ22mm (with box header)

Since this is a very simple module I didn't add an additional BOM. The gain factor of the amplifier circuit depends on resistor R7. With the 240K resistor I used the factor is 2,4x. This module is the perfect companion for my digiLFO and my envelope generator modules.
