# POWER SUPPLY UNIT (6HP)

* Standard AC to bipolar 12V Eurorack PSU
* Has an ON-OFF switch
* Two indicator LEDs
* Needs a 12 VAC! wall wart (DC wall warts will not work!)
* WARNING (HEALTH HAZARD): Only use caps with a voltage rating of **AT LEAST 35V**!
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: Depending on capacitor height (with 4700uF caps: â‰ˆ47mm)

Additional information: Caps C3 and C6 should have a capacity of at very least 3300uF! Better use a higher value like 4700uF. And again: ONLY 35V CAPS OR HIGHER RATINGS! You should add heat sinks to the regulators (use small but as big as possible ones)
