# DUAL VCA

* 3HP
* Similar to the vca design that can be found in the SEM and the PRO-ONE
* Two Inputs per vca
* Works best with unipolar CV

A bit of CV bleedthrough becomes audible when using high frequency CV but that's not a problem in normal use cases.
I guess you could use PJ-324 jacks instead of the more expensive Lumberg ones but I never tried it.
