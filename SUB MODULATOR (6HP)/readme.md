# SUB MODULATOR (6HP)

* Sub-oscillator module that generates square waves with various forms and frequencies
* Frequencies of incoming signals can be divided by 2, 3 and 4 (-1 oct., '-1.5 otc.', -2 oct.)
* /2 and /4 generate 50% duty cycle square waves, /3 can be 33% or 66% duty cycle square waves
* The input signal and the output of the suboscillator also get send through a XOR gate which creates ring modulator like timbres
* The pulse width of the carrier wave can be altered with the THRESHOLD potentiometer (only works when using sine, saw or triangle waves as an input)
* XOR and SUB outputs are roughly 10Vpp (bipolar)
* There is an additional, buffered THRU output that just outputs the input signal
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: â‰ˆ22mm (with box header)

I really like this module! The XOR output generates very interesting waveforms and the ability to play perfect fifths (between -1 and -2 octaves) is a not very common but very lovely feature. It is great for producing sound with a massive low end. Use a mixer to mix the outputs of the SUB MODULATOR together with the input signal.
