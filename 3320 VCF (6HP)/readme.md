# 3320 VCF (6HP)

**_Will upload the gerber files in the next days_**

* Voltage controlled lowpass filter based on the CEM3320/AS3320
* VCF output buffer and resonance path close to the PRO-ONE design 
* Good sounding 24db per octave
* Able to selfoscillate
* Pitchtracking works alright over a few octaves
* Two CV inputs (CV2 is connected to an attenuator pot)
* Signal input attenuator 
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: â‰ˆ47mm

Overall a pretty decent VCF module. I tested it quite some time and didn't run into any problems. It sounds good :)
