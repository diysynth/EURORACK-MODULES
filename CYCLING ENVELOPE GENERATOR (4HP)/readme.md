# CYCLING ENVELOPE GENERATOR (4HP)

* Can be used as an envelope generator or as a 'LFO'
* Cycling/Looping mode is enabled when there is no patch cable plugged into the gate jack
* Unipolar output
* Output Voltage envelope mode: ≈0-10V / cycling mode: ≈0.5-8.5V
* The envelope generator doesn't retrigger while it cycles through the attack phase
* Range switch for two different speeds
* Aluminium pcb option for the front panel is recommended
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: ≈22mm (with box header connector)

This module is the successor to my looping A-R generator from 2022.
