# 0HP Multiple

A simple but nice looking multiple for eurorack and semi modulars. The jacks are Lumberg 1503-09/PJ-324. You need 2x M3 screws with a length of 15-18mm and 4x M3 nuts.
It's my first design that uses mouse bites though all pcb layers come on one panel. 
After breaking the panel into single pcbs you can use sandpaper to get rid of the mouse bite leftovers.
