# NOISE LAB (3HP)

* Noise module that is able to generate analog and 'digital' noise
* Two outputs for white noise
* The digitalized noise gets divided with a binary counter
* There are four different divider outputs
* The threshold parameter for the digital noise can be CV controlled (unipolar CV works best)
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: â‰ˆ22mm (with box header)

It is fun and quite versatile module. The CV controlled digital noise can create some nice video game sounds. Experimanting with different sources for the CV can be rewarding. There is a sound sample that showcases the different waveforms.
