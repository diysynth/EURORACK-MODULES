# DIGILFO (VCLFO, 6HP)

* Voltage-controlled LFO based on Electric Druid's STOMPLFO chip
* Can produce eight different waveforms (ramp up, ramp down, square, triangle, sine, sweep, random steps, random slopes)
* Produces an output signal of 6Vpp (+/-3V)
* Can be synced to an external clock or gate signal
* CV input range for frequency modulation is 0-5V
* Slowest cycle speed is around 20 seconds (0,05Hz), fastest is around 25Hz
* Output signal can be attenuated via a potentiometer 
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: â‰ˆ22mm (with box header)

It is a really well working little LFO perfect for all kinds of modulation tasks in an eurorack system. The output filter produces a smooth output without any audible stepping or aliasing.
