# PASSIVE LOW PASS GATE

* Very simple passive LPG that leaves enough room to use it with diy vactrols
* Toggle switch for switiching through different filter modes
* Two CV inputs
* 2HP
* Only through-hole parts
* Depth: â‰ˆ13mm

Try different values for C2/C3 (maybe in the range from 4.7nF up to 47nF) and leave C1 empty to have a VCA-mode in the middle position of the switch. 

You will need the following components:

* Resistors: 2x 470R, 1x 100R
* Diodes: 1x 1N4148 or similar
* Jacks: 4x PJ398SM (Thonkiconn)
* Capacitors: 2x or 3x different values up to 47nF (5mm pitch)
* Standard toggle switch (on-off-on)
* Diy vactrol
